### <div align="center">Summary:</div>

 Results-driven person with a solid technical background and experience in automation of logistics and supply chain processes. Being always on cutting edge of the IT technologies I set up my goal to change the field from project management in production to Web development, software engineering & cloud technologies. With a big passion to study I'm building my hard skills brick by brick in order to become a full stack guru.

  if next_page:
    next_url = next_page.get('href')
    URL = urljoin(URL, next_url)
  else:
    break

# Create and write results into .csv file

with open('pershi-stravy.csv', 'w', newline='') as csv_file:
  csv_writer = csv.writer(csv_file)
  csv_writer.writerow(['name'])

# Create and write results into .xlsx file

excel_file = openpyxl.Workbook()
excel_writer = excel_file.active
excel_writer['A1'] = 'name'

for first_dish in first_dishes_name:
