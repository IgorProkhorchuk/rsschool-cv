### Summary:

 Results-driven person with a solid technical background and experience in automation of logistics and supply chain processes. Being always on cutting edge of the IT technologies I set up my goal to change the field from project management in production to Web development, software engineering & cloud technologies. With a big passion to study I'm building my hard skills brick by brick in order to become a full stack guru.
